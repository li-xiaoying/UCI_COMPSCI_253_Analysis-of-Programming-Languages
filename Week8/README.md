# Compile and Run the program with the following commands

## Week 8

```
cd Week8
```

### Three
To run Three.py in Shell:
```
python Three.py ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
The program doesn't filter out stop_words.txt, so the expected output should be:
```
0F TH3 - 491
T0 B3 - 445
1N TH3 - 397
MR D4RCY - 273
T0 TH3 - 268
```
